# Orchestrate Kubernetes API

This is a simple (proof-of-concept) API layer on top of the Kubernetes API.  It is designed to provide a simple way to execute adhoc commands in a stand-alone containers as jobs.

## Setup

```bash
# create orchestrator resources
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/orchestrator.yml

# get list of pods in the namespace
kubectl get pods -n orchestrator

kubectl get jobs -n orchestrator

POD=$(kubectl get pods -n orchestrator | grep orchestrator | awk '{print $1}' | head -n 1)

# get list of pods in the namespace
kubectl get svc -n orchestrator

minikube service orchestrator-svc --url -n orchestrator

# get pod logs
kubectl logs -f -n orchestrator $POD

kubectl describe job/job-test -n orchestrator

# delete pod
kubectl delete pod/$POD -n orchestrator

kubectl delete pod/sleep-pod -n orchestrator
kubectl delete jobs/sleep-pod -n orchestrator


kubectl exec -it $POD -n orchestrator -- /bin/bash
```

## Testing

```bash
# To point your shell to minikube's docker-daemon, run:
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

# build container image with the orchestrator API
make build
# or 
docker build -t orchestrator .

# deploy orchestrator service to minikube
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/orchestrator.yml

# get minikube IP
SERVICE_ENDPOINT=$(minikube service orchestrator-svc --url -n orchestrator)

# check if service up and running
curl -s "${SERVICE_ENDPOINT}/"
# output:
# {"status":"alive"}

# create a job with a specific bash command
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"cmd":"python3 -c \"import this\""}' "${SERVICE_ENDPOINT}/jobs"
# output:

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
